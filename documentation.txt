GENERAL NOTES:

- 'Nug' is short for 'nugget'. It refers to a nugget of content, an HTML element that contains actual material,
as opposed to an HTML element that is purely structural or peripheral, like containers or labels. As a general rule,
nugget elements should not have children elements, especially not other nuggets. A nugget should be the pearl of
actual content at the deepest layer of nested elements. 

- Arrays of spell-slot quantities use the actual index to represent the spell level, so the first element
of such an array should always be 0 (because you can't have zero-level spell slots, but we want them
all to be integers for consistency).
